  # Scanner events occur when the lexer hits a new token, like a keyword or an
  # end. These nodes always contain just one argument which is a string
  # representing the content. For the most part these can just be printed
  # directly, which very few exceptions.
  SCANNER_EVENTS.each do |event|
    define_method(:"on_#{event}") do |body|
      { type: :"@#{event}", body: body, start: lineno, end: lineno }
    end
  end

  # Parser events represent nodes in the ripper abstract syntax tree. The event
  # is reported after the children of the node have already been built.
  PARSER_EVENTS.each do |event|
    define_method(:"on_#{event}") do |*body|
      min = body.map { |part| part.is_a?(Hash) ? part[:start] : lineno }.min
      { type: event, body: body, start: min || lineno, end: lineno }
    end
  end

  # Some nodes are lists that come back from the parser. They always start with
  # a `*_new` node (or in the case of string, `*_content`) and each additional
  # node in the list is a `*_add` node. This module takes those nodes and turns
  # them into one node with an array body.
  #
  # For example, the statement `[a, b, c]` would be parsed as:
  #
  # [:args_add,
  #   [:args_add,
  #     [:args_add,
  #       [:args_new],
  #       [:vcall, [:@ident, "a", [1, 1]]]
  #     ],
  #     [:vcall, [:@ident, "b", [1, 4]]]
  #   ],
  #   [:vcall, [:@ident, "c", [1, 7]]]
  # ]
  #
  # But after this module is applied that is instead parsed as:
  #
  # [:args,
  #   [
  #     [:vcall, [:@ident, "a", [1, 1]]],
  #     [:vcall, [:@ident, "b", [1, 4]]],
  #     [:vcall, [:@ident, "c", [1, 7]]]
  #   ]
  # ]
  #
  # This makes it a lot easier to join things with commas, and ends up resulting
  # in a much flatter `prettier` tree once it has been converted. Note that
  # because of this module some extra node types are added (the aggregate of
  # the previous `*_add` nodes) and some nodes now have arrays in places where
  # they previously had single nodes.
